# vSphere Powershell Helper Scripts
Just a collection of Powershell scripts to help automate some functions in vSphere - particularly for those of us that don't some of the nice features of vSphere Enterprise!

The current scripts are:
- **vSphere_Change_Root_Password.ps1** - Updates the root (or any local user) password on multiple VMhosts
- **vSphere_Copy_Portgroups.ps1** - Copies portgroups from one vSphere host to another
- **vSphere_Evacuate_Host.ps1** - Evacuates VMs from a vSphere host to other hosts in the same cluster
